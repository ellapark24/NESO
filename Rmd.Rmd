## R Markdown

Testing

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data setup}
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("20161213_uk_wind_solar_demand_temperature_SCS2.csv")

# Convert the 'Local Time' column to POSIXlt objects
datetime_objs <- strptime(data$`Local Time`, format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M")


# Extract month (add 1 since months are 0-based)
data$Month <- datetime_objs$mon + 1


# Extract weekday as number (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday)
data$WeekdayNum <- datetime_objs$wday

# Or extract weekday name
data$WeekdayName <- weekdays(datetime_objs)

# Define the months you want to keep
desired_months <- c(11, 12, 1, 2, 3)

# Filter rows where Month is in desired_months
filtered_data <- data[data$Month %in% desired_months, ]

view(filtered_data)
```
