## R Markdown

Testing

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data setup}

data <- read_csv("20161213_uk_wind_solar_demand_temperature_SCS2.csv")

data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    # First, convert the character string to a datetime object
    Local_DateTime = dmy_hm(`Local Time`),
    # Then, use lubridate functions to extract components
    Month = month(Local_DateTime),
    WeekdayNum = wday(Local_DateTime) - 1, # wday is 1-based (1=Sun), so subtract 1 for 0-based
    Year = year(Local_DateTime)
  )

# Define the months you want to keep
desired_months <- c(11, 12, 1, 2, 3)

# Filter rows where Month is in desired_months
filtered_data <- data[data$Month %in% desired_months & data$Year != 2015, ]

filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(
    Date = as.Date(dmy_hm(`Local Time`))  # Extract full date
  ) %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarise(
    across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()


```
